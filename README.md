# Abstract
The term structure of green bonds plays an important role in determining pricing practices and informing green bond portfolio design. We introduce a novel green bond yield spread measure, derived from the term structure of yields to maturity embedding curve-based information into bond valuation. We screen structural attribute associations of green municipal bond curve-based spreads using Association Rule Learning and find that taxable green
bonds with intermediate maturities and short durations are systematically linked to positive spreads. Screened green bond groups then inform the construction of tenor- and duration-based portfolios that deliver lower drawdowns and higher, more stable risk-adjusted returns relative to Treasury, particularly during periods of monetary tightening, while hybrid portfolios preserve most downside protection benefits. This superior performance is attributed to curve-level pricing and structural composition. The term structure framework
develops profitable portfolio strategies to inform investors, issuers, and regulators in shaping transparent and efficient sustainable finance ecosystems.
